# Lab 1: Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables seamless integration between LLMs and external data sources or tools. This standardized protocol acts as a bridge, allowing AI assistants to access and utilize various data sources, making them more capable and context-aware.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol is an open protocol that standardizes how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with external data sources and tools. It was introduced by Anthropic to create a consistent way for applications to provide context to LLMs, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction.

Think of MCP as a "web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions." It defines a standardized way for:

1. **Exposing data** through Resources (similar to GET endpoints in REST APIs)
2. **Providing functionality** through Tools (similar to POST endpoints)
3. **Defining interaction patterns** through Prompts (reusable templates)

## Why MCP Matters

Before MCP, developers had to create custom integrations for each LLM and each data source, resulting in fragmented and non-standardized solutions. MCP solves this by:

- Providing a **unified interface** for LLMs to interact with external resources
- Enabling **composition of capabilities** from multiple sources
- Allowing for **secure and controlled access** to external systems
- Supporting a **standardized way** to expose functionality to LLMs

## Core Benefits of MCP

### 1. Interoperability

MCP ensures that any tool exposed by any number of MCP servers can seamlessly plug into agents. This means you can build components once and reuse them across different AI applications.

### 2. Composability & Customizability

MCP implements well-defined workflows in a composable way, enabling compound workflows and allowing full customization across model providers, logging systems, orchestrators, and more.

### 3. Programmatic Control Flow

Developers can write code with familiar constructs like if/while statements instead of thinking in terms of graphs, nodes, and edges. This makes development more intuitive and maintainable.

### 4. Human Input & Signals

MCP supports pausing workflows for external signals, such as human input, which are exposed as tool calls an agent can make. This enables human-in-the-loop scenarios critical for many AI applications.

## MCP Architecture Overview

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Servers**: Expose resources, tools, and prompts to LLMs
- **MCP Clients**: Applications that connect to these servers (e.g., Claude Desktop)
- **Protocol Messages**: Standardized format for communication between clients and servers

## How MCP Works in a Multi-Agent RAG System

In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, MCP can:

1. Connect agents to vector databases for knowledge retrieval
2. Provide standardized access to document repositories
3. Enable controlled access to external APIs and services
4. Facilitate communication between different agents in the system

Each agent can leverage multiple MCP servers, combining their capabilities to accomplish complex tasks.

## Demonstration: Claude with MCP

Let's see a practical example of how Claude can interact with an MCP server to access external data.

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Note the MCP Server configuration in the settings
3. Ask Claude a question that requires accessing external data, such as:
   - "Can you search through my project documentation for information about user authentication?"
   - "Could you retrieve information about product SKU-12345 from my catalog?"

Claude will:
- Recognize the need for external data
- Invoke the appropriate MCP server tool
- Incorporate the retrieved information into its response

This demonstration shows how Claude seamlessly integrates with external data sources through the MCP protocol.

## Next Steps

In the next section, we'll dive deeper into the MCP Protocol fundamentals and understand the core components that make it work.
